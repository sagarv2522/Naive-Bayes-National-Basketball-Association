## Introduction 🔗

* You work for a firm that provides insights for management and coaches in the National Basketball Association (NBA), a professional basketball league in North America. The league is interested in retaining players who can last in the high-pressure environment of professional basketball and help the team be successful over time. Build a model that predicts whether a player will have an NBA career lasting five years or more. 

* The data for this activity consists of performance statistics from each player's rookie year. There are 1,341 observations, and each observation in the data represents a different player in the NBA. Your target variable is a Boolean value that indicates whether a given player will last in the league for five years.
